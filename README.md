## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between weather patterns and public interest in protection from the sun. The weather data is pulled from Visual Crossing Weather, an online source providing historical and forecast weather data. A Python script is used to scrape the dataset from VC's Weather API. This dataset tracks maximum temperatures in the U.S. from 2020 to 2024. The public interest is gauged via proxy data, namely Google Trends data for certain search keywords. Similarly to the weather dataset, a Python script is used to scrape the dataset from Google Trends, via the pytrends library. The dataset includes information regarding the popularity of the search keywords: "sunscreen," "SPF," "UV protection," and "skincare," and the timeframe spans 2020 to 2024.
